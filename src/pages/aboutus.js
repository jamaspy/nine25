          Our Story
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Nine25 (pronounced nine-to-five) wants to bring the way we get paid to
          the digital era. The concept of a paycheque is alien to anyone who's
          under 30 years. It's a relic from the pre-computerised age when an
          actual person had to sit and write out a cheque for every employee.
          That work took weeks. So people got paid once a fortnight or once a
          month. At Nine25, we're upending this old world relic with our
          real-time salarystreaming service.

          Our Mission
        </p>
        <p className="mb-12 text-lg">
          Technology is progressing at a rapid rate and our lifestyles are
          thriving because of it. The financial world on the other hand, is
          lagging In comparison to our fast paced, quick access way of living,
          the ancient idea of a 'Pay Day' is becoming harder to comprehend. Why
          do we still wait up to a week, a fortnight or even a month for our
          pockets to replenish and our freedoms to carry on. We want to have
          live-access to our pay as we earn it. We stream movies, tv shows,
          music - we even stream our personal lives online. It's time we are
          able to do the same with our money. Managing finances is tricky - on
          your own. Nine25 has the financial know-how and we believe financial
          freedom is possible for everyone, so we are building the technology to
          enable it.
